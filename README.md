FBlightBox
==========

Lightbox plugin that resembles facebooks.

#justanotherlightboxplugin

This is the First Jquery plugin I've created. 

I wanted to have something that looked like Facebook's lightbox, but that could be used for two things:
1. for a gallery of images
2. for portfolio elements that has both an image and a discription. This is where it look's like Facebook's the most.

update: HTML should be set up like this for the portfolio option:

<code>
<div class=”portfolio”>
    <ul>
		<li>
            <a href=”http://placehold.it/400x400”>
                <img src=”http://placehold.it/200x200”>
                <div class="here">
                	<div class=”stuff”>
                        <h2>Stuff1</h2>
                        <div>
                            stuff
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
			</a>
        </li>
    </ul> 
</div>
</code>
